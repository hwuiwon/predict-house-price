# Machine Learning : Boston Housing Prices

This project applies basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

## **Software and Libraries**

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.6
- keras
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## **Introduction**

The dataset for this project was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at CMU by using [Keras](https://keras.io/datasets/).

## **Features**

The following behavioral trends are expected from the data:
- **RM** : The prices increase with increase in the average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **LSTAT** : This means percentage lower status of the population. Prices should be high when LSTAT is low and vice versa. Wealthy families tend to have more expensive homes.
